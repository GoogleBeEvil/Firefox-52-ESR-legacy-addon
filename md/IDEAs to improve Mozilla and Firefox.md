# IDEAs to improve Mozilla and Firefox

- At present day, Mozilla Corporation is a "ballCracy" ruled by balls of guys on top, I don't think is democracy is best, but some kind of holocracy or at leasst, non dictatorship/vertical Corporation would be healthy.

- Mozilla and Firefox are brands, names, we could change the concept behind and make better, we don't need be renegade rogue people and abandon the idea behind them, and create ForkFox and shit one more time.
- I don't know what model of organization and tools use Mozilla to integrate a P2P community of developers and employees around the world, but I think, the core team is formed by a few of superheroes like "Marco Bonardo"
- Marco Bonardo works in Firefox places (bookmarks, history), when I started to research bugs, I always see that guy around, that is literally a lot of work for "a few guys"
- The access to code and source and Mercurial repositories maybe are not the most usable and UX-friendly shit (just saying)
- All I write here is my opinion, maybe I am wrong (if that is the case, when I realize I update), but now I think this
