# Firefox Places (bookmarks, history) & query syntax

Firefox is the only browser that support tag bookmarks in a consistent way without folder=tags cheating and good implemented (could be improved, yes)
Firefox addons killed with good functionality like
related to **"Patch For Library" and "TagSieve" and "SearchPlaces" addons**
[Firefox Places query-syntax on MozillaZine thread ](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?t=629560)

this allow use powerfull tagging in firefox places without external apps or web/apps, locally (is a plus) and using places.sqlite as urls container (easy enought) in addition to this Pinboard Diigo, Delicious (RIP) and others seems to allow some type of tagging and formats, yeah i know exist a very large number of cms-based, proyects, Delicious clones, desktop apps, etc but hey, this is cross platform and is on local desktop browser (easy to mantain) fast enough and connected to browser

tagging is a must-have for me and smartFolders or virtualFolders as "auto.tagging" container too 

*I interested on browsers customization because we use them all the time, the most of the time, and productivity integration with addons and configs is a must have for me in my research and work (so yes, i am a browser poweruser who makes magic with software)
