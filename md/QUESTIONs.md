# QUESTIONs

# Why Mozilla kills now totally XUL, XPCOM based addons?

- This path was marked around two years ago (2015) or before
- The key aspect is WebExtensions are not a proper replacere
- Most users, and devs are dissapointed 
- The weak user, complain and do nothing or go to Chromium
- The dev, powerUser or veteran go fork or complain and delete compulsively his creations
- The result of this move for community base is totally negative

# What community think as heterogeneous group about XUL, XPCOM purge (aka #XulLeaks)

All I read on web, blogs, communities, Reddit is:
- People don't care because they will use Chrome or are ignorant, honestly about importante of stable environments for end users
- People complaining, but impotent, and eventually do nothing (passive users)
- People complaining, active whom will migrate to som ESR build or WaterFox (support until Q2/2018) until "They figure out what's going on" or set a new stable workspace
- Darwinism shit about "evolve or die, shit changes continuously" => Being an dogmatic on software os a bad idea

# My opinion

- It is clear to me, that we, the users, first must use what we want, any time
- Mozilla is the owner of Firefox (and literally as corporation, could kill Firefox at any time, they are free to do that)
- Open Software community must think about, why all main browsers are under control of corporations and bad support at the end of core features, or implementations
- Something that is a key on browsers like bookmarking or sync, it is a completely shit or obsolete in most browsers, and no allo zero-knowledge or customization in a stable way
- The "addons,extensions for all syndrome" cause that even bugs (Firefox Bugzilla) has some of this, are fixed by addons and not added to code base
- I will try to contribute to Firefox or Waterfox with code and patches and even think about rescue XUL XPCOM and XUL-Runner and modernize it (beyond addons structure) if some folks join the adventure
# About webArchiving and browsers
- webArchiving is key and a crucial ability, all the work we can do locally it is good
- web services are good, but sometimes we need a saving service locally
- I love Shelve, UnMHT and MAFF, MHT addons and this shit move make them obsolete without replacer, (insert here a SHIT "SH3...:it" from The Wire nigga)


# Why open source community don't collaborate in a real way on web browser development (oligopoly)
- People, individuals must at leat merge efforts
- Now we have two real branches of development lead by Google and Mozilla (I suppose Mozilla is independent from Google, but who knows)
- Chromium (Blink, Webkit, V8.js) => Google Chrome, Opera, etc and Brave (one of founders of Mozilla and Firefox create "YET ANOTHER BROWSER" Chromium clone", yeah, perfect (sarcasm)
- Firefox (Gecko, Servo(wip)) => Firefox (Iceweasel, Seamonkey, WaterFox are lack of resources or follow the base code of Mozilla)
- *I respect people work, but Pale Moon seems obsolete to me and i dont know why they don't join to WaterFox, this is open source for god shake
- *other browser I know, but i never use (Maxthon,)
- *Microsoft Edge, Explorer etc, Safari, are propietary softare so are in a different (more coherent path)

# I am tired of ego shit, why sometimes openSource is full of small dictators and auto-sabotages?
	- ForkSyndrome (non-constructive)
	- Oligopoly in a key software like webBrowser, one of the most important software components all world use
