< addons.mozilla.org - On November 2017, Mozilla will release Firefox 57, which will only support WebExtensions.[1] It is curently unclear what exactly will happen with the thousands of "legacy add-ons". Currently, later versions of Firefox will be unable to download these addons, though the download link can still be easily reached by digging into the source code.
