# AMO (Addons.Mozill.org) notes
## [Addons Mozilla (AMO)](http://addons.mozilla.org/) (AMO for now) state
aprox 20.900 extensions (addons) 
aprox 1000 pages with 20 extensions (per.page)
seems that only  first 1000 addons ordered by users usage number are relevant at first batch.

If a Diogenes Syndrome method is applied we could go until page.300 (6000 addons) total is 20.900 so is about a 33% saved and relevant (not bad meme here)
- Curation and hierarchy is a need because even "saving everything" approach, for me webArchiving must be useful not only "Diogenes Syndrome"
- Curation by hierarchy of "important ones"
logic: more users (more key feature, more value, more needed etc) => this is false globally but applies good for relevance => popularity => masses => users volume usage so (more quality, importance)
  
- **Most used addon is (by far) Adblock Plus with 14.4M (millions) of users (aprox)**
- Followed by **Video Download Helper 3.7M (millions) and NoScript 1.7M (millions) of users (aprox)** we see that difference is notable even in most used addons (it is known that **AdBlock is a demanded "IT friend install me an ad blocker"**), **uBLock** is about **4M (millions)** Adblock is better than uBlock? (i think not) but this is because "inertia" of "who first arrive" or "veteran" and **AdBlock** name seems more "known than > *uBlock* (seems to be an explaination)

 (this is for explain the selected method of curation) and at least "non automation" beyond less x user usage number: [updated to 2017-10]
- At page 10 (10*20) => 200 addons later aprox usage is about 50k (50.000 users)
- At page 50 (50*20) => 1000 addons later aprox usage is about 6k (6000 users)
- 1000 addons and 6000 users as bottom limit (seems fine) to "keep confidence" about archiving "useful addons"
because logic: "if users ( a decent number don't use an addon, therefore is not useful, good etc")
 - At page 100 (2000 users per addon) and 2000 addons later (minor addons maybe useful, but non key features i think
- At page 200 (aprox 400 users per addon) and 4000 addons later (i dont see much valuable but, we could SaveThem'all hahaha
- At page 300 (aprox 150 users per addon) and 6000 addons later (maybe some gems, which nobody knows has good ideas for new features)
- At page 500 (aprox 30 users per addon, this is low enought to say, addons beyond this dont deserve our time, with exception of abandon but interesting or exceptions "exceptionale" so this would be my limit

Conclusion: 
## Method of archiving
 
I use webScraping and webMining to extract a graph of words and structured data from Mozilla and group addons with keywords in a graph then y design a tree of features and take ideas for example:

 - cookies, management, backup, edit, etc 
 - password, with tags, sync, keepass, integration
 - bookmarks, tags, sync, edit, gui 
 - custmization, theme 
 - search, engine, backup 
 - backup, FEBE, CLEO, OPIE, places, CSV, import, export
  
  
*this is easy, fast and never backup "shit" addons, take bes on one niche or category, for example **InstantFox** on custom search/engines
 
## AMO and killed addons

What about addons not listed because mozilla or author kill them (like SearchPlaces, Zotero (the integrated Firefox version, now is standalone) or others like Patch For Library (which is important for me for personal purposes), well, you must reverse search on web archives or MozillaZine, gHacks old news, to retrieve "some useful addons" like Shelve, that masses never know about.
